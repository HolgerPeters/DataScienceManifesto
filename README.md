# Welcome to the Data Science Manifesto
This is meant as a first draft and a blueprint for the Data Science Manifesto. These days, many myths, misunderstandings, false expectations grow around what used to be a common understanding what Data Science is and what a Data Scientist might be. I deeply believe there is such a common understanding and therefore this manifesto is intensionally planned as a collaborative document where everybody is invited to contribute. Furthermore, the whole field is evolving at an incredible speed and therefore this manifesto will embrace change and evolve over time.

In the spirit of the two books from 'Uncle Bob' ("Clean Code" and "The Clean Coder") I would suggest to divide the manifesto into a part describing the field data science and a second part describing the role of the data scientist.

## Data Science

### 1. Data Science generates measurable value based on data

Data Science differs from traditional data analysis or data processing by it's claim to generate value purely based on data. There are many overlapping cases of course, but it is not data science if it is not adding measurable value. Measurable value implies that the imact of the data science effort is immediate, at least one con show a direct dependency of the data science work and the additional generated value.

### 2. Data Science is Science

Not in a sense, that the results are used or even usefull for science. It is science because the way of work is identical to the way of work in science. Mainly this means that all results can be reproduced and validated in a transparent manner. There is no room for magic or even ad-hoc methods that lack solid foundation, either statistically or in the given context.

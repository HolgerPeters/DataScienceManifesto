# Welcome to the Data Science Manifesto
This is meant as a first draft and a blueprint for the Data Science Manifesto. These days, many myths, misunderstandings, false expectations grow around what used to be a common understanding what Data Science is and what a Data Scientist might be. I deeply believe there is such a common understanding and therefore this manifesto is intensionally planned as a collaborative document where everybody is invited to contribute. Furthermmore, the whole field is evolving in incredible speed and therefore this manifesto will embrace change and evolve over time.

In the spirit of the two books from 'Uncle Bob' ("Clean Code" and "The Clean Coder") I would suggest to divide the manifesto into a part describing the field data science and a second part describing the role of the data scientist.

## 1. Data Science
